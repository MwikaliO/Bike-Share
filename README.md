## Dataset

* This data set consist of 183 000 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset include the following features rider duration, Stations, time, gender of the rider and  also user type. The dataset i choosed from the compiled list on the udacity project.
* The dataset had some missing values in some row were removed.
* The start time and end time column had some data that were extracted lead to addition of number of columns 

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, started with single plot checked on the distribution of duration and found to be unimodal with average duration of 500 second.
Customers don't share bike only subscribers
I found that there was a strong relationship between young people and the bike ride durations.
Also observed that though the number of higher duration trip is higher for male but percentage is higher for women and other.
We find that higher percentage of customers are taking longer trips then compared to subscribers.
I also expected that categorial variable's like user type and gender values having higher value to be having higher trip duration but it is the other way round like for gender, value of male members is very high but the percentage of female members to take longer trips is higher.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For presentation, I focused on the birth year and bike ride duration. I started by introducing the duration variable, followed by the pattern of the Member birth year. then plot a scatter plot.
I used the countplot on the categorical variable.
The other categorical variable and the duration were covered using pointplot. Made use of different color so that the difference between the plots can be easily notified.
